# timezone-olson

On Hackage: [timezone-olson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson)

This package provides a parser and renderer for binary Olson timezone
files whose format is specified by the tzfile(5) man page on Unix-like
systems. For more information about this format, see
[the IANA timezone database site](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

Functions are provided for
converting the parsed data into `TimeZoneSeries` objects from the
[timezone-series](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-series)
package. On many platforms, binary Olson timezone
files suitable for use with this package are available in the
directory `/usr/share/zoneinfo` and its subdirectories on your computer.

See also the
[timezone-olson-th](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson-th)
package for a way to include timezone informaton from a binary Olson
timezone file at compile time.

## Testing utilities

This package also provides two Haskell files, each of which can be
compiled into a command-line utility that might be helpful for testing
purposes.

zhdump.hs: A clone of zdump(8), including most of its bugs, that
           is usually present on systems that have an Olson timezone
           database, except hzdump takes paths to timezone files
           instead of timezone identifiers on the command line.

catTZ:     Read and parse a timezone file, then render it. With the
           -i flag, interprets the timezone data as a TimeZoneSeries
           object before rendering.
